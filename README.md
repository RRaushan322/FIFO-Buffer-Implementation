# FIFO-Buffer-Implementation
Overview
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer. A FIFO buffer is used in digital systems to temporarily store and manage data, ensuring that the first data item added is the first to be removed. This implementation is designed to be flexible and parameterizable.

Features
Generic FIFO Buffer: Configurable depth and width.
Asynchronous Reset: Resets the FIFO to a known state.
Full/Empty Indicators: Flags to manage buffer status.
Clocked Operation: Functions on the rising edge of the clock signal.
File Structure
fifo_buffer.v: Main Verilog module for the FIFO buffer.
fifo_tb.v: Testbench for simulating the FIFO buffer.
README.md: This file.
Module Description
fifo_buffer.v
The fifo_buffer module implements the FIFO buffer with the following parameters and ports:

Parameters:

DATA_WIDTH: Width of the data bus (e.g., 8, 16).
FIFO_DEPTH: Depth of the FIFO buffer (number of entries).
Ports:

input clk: Clock signal.
input rst: Asynchronous reset signal.
input wr_en: Write enable signal.
input rd_en: Read enable signal.
input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] din: Data input.
output [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] dout: Data output.
output full: Indicates if the FIFO is full.
output empty: Indicates if the FIFO is empty.
Example Instantiation:

verilog
Copy code
fifo_buffer #(
    .DATA_WIDTH(8),
    .FIFO_DEPTH(16)
) fifo_inst (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .wr_en(wr_en),
    .rd_en(rd_en),
    .din(din),
    .dout(dout),
    .full(full),
    .empty(empty)
);
Testbench
fifo_tb.v
The fifo_tb testbench provides a simulation environment to validate the FIFO buffer implementation. It generates stimulus to test various FIFO operations, including write and read operations, and status flag assertions.

Running the Testbench:

To simulate the FIFO buffer, use a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim or VCS. Follow these steps:

Compile the Verilog Files:

bash
Copy code
vlog fifo_buffer.v fifo_tb.v
Run the Simulation:

bash
Copy code
vsim fifo_tb
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fifo-buffer-verilog.git
cd fifo-buffer-verilog
Integrate the FIFO Buffer:

Copy the fifo_buffer.v file into your project directory and instantiate it in your design as required.

Simulate and Verify:

Use the provided testbench (fifo_tb.v) to verify the functionality of the FIFO buffer.
